1. First step is to run the requirement.txt file to install all the libraries and dependencies.
1. Run pyGen.py first to generate your naive bayes classifier models for all 4 different classes. It will generate few scores which will give the training data size and the features used while training the model.
1. Run pyPredict(use your own Twitter keys) and enter the username you want to predict.
